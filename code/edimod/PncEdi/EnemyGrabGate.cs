// One rule, applied to every enemy: do not commit to a grab the game is going to refuse.
//
// GrabScreen.StartGrab opens with
//
//     if (isGrabbed) return;
//     if (playerStats == null || !playerStats.CanBeGrabbed) return;
//
// and does none of its setup in those cases. The ~1 s post-grab immunity (vanilla's own
// GrabScreen.GrabImmunity coroutine) therefore turns every enemy's grab connection into a
// silent no-op - while the ENEMY side has already run whatever it does before the call.
//
// Audited across the whole assembly, every call site of GrabScreen.StartGrab. They fall into
// three groups:
//
//   handles refusal correctly (`if (!grabScreen.IsGrabbed) return;` straight after):
//     EnemyAI.HandleGrabHit, EnemyAI.OnPlayerGrabDetected,
//     SpinningEnemyAI.HandleGrabHit, ProjectileEnemyAI.OnGrabProjectileHitPlayer
//
//   does NOT check, and commits state regardless:
//     DragonEnemyAI.HandleGrabHit / .OnPlayerGrabDetected
//     ProximityDragonEnemyAI.HandleGrabHit / .OnPlayerGrabDetected
//       -> sets hasTriggeredDragonGrab (one-shot), calls ModifyGrabForDragon(),
//          unconditionally stops grabCoroutine, then calls RemoveEnemyAfterGrab().
//          A refused grab removes the dragon from the level with no scene ever playing.
//     MimicEnemy.TriggerMimicGrab
//       -> burns hasTriggeredGrab and destroys itself; see MimicGrabGate (§44), which is the
//          same rule applied at the mimic's own entry point.
//
//   not an enemy path: GrappleScreenobject.TriggerTrioGrabOverflow (left alone).
//
// So the dragons had the same defect as the mimic and nobody had hit it yet, and the four
// "correct" ones are only correct about the grab - SpinningEnemyAI still strands its state
// machine for unrelated reasons (see AiStateGuard).
//
// ONLY the dragons are patched, and that restriction is load-bearing rather than caution.
// Vanilla's refused-grab path in the four correct classes does real work:
//
//     hasGrabbedThisAttempt = true;    // this swing is spent
//     grabInDamagingState = false;     // stop testing for the rest of the window
//     StartGrab(...);
//     if (!grabScreen.IsGrabbed) return;
//
// Those two assignments are what make a refused grab *whiff*. Gating the method skips them, so
// the enemy would keep testing every frame and connect the instant immunity lapsed - escape a
// grab and be re-grabbed by the same enemy a second later, mid-swing. That is a worse game than
// the one being fixed, and those three classes have no bug to fix in the first place. Left
// alone deliberately; do not "finish the set" by adding them.
//
// For the dragons there is no such trade: the alternative to gating is being deleted from the
// level. They pay the same cost (their swing no longer self-cancels) for a much larger benefit.
// MimicEnemy is handled at its own entry point in MimicGrabGate (§44) for the same reason.

// The Black Serpent's camera grab, scripted by how close it is.
//
// `canHypnotise` on BrawlerEnemyAI, in the game's own tooltip: "it drags the player's camera onto
// itself while it's on-screen and advances until it lands a grab". There is no grab screen behind
// it and no cum clip - the three Hypnosis clips sit on the enemy's own controller beside Idle and
// Walk - which is why §71 left `serpent_hypnosis_*` mapped to skip and said so. That decision was
// right for a dispatch keyed on an animator state: the state alone says "hypnotising" and nothing
// about how close the thing is, so the only script it could have chosen would have been the same
// one at 8 m and at 2 m. What makes this scriptable is the *distance*, which is not in the state.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS DOES THAT NOTHING ELSE IN THE MOD DOES
//
//   * **Distance drives intensity.** It has only ever driven audibility - `AmbientProximity`
//     picks a diorama by whether the player can hear its loop. Nothing else in the mod varies
//     anything continuously; every other choice is a dispatch.
//   * **It changes the device without changing what is playing.** Every other switch in the mod
//     POSTs a different row name. This one POSTs `Edi/Intensity/{max}`, which scales the device's
//     stroke range in place while the same row keeps looping - so closing in changes how far the
//     device travels without changing where it is, with no seam to carry a phase across.
//
// The band is the prefab's own: `hypnosisStartRange` (8 m on the shipped serpent) down to
// `grabRange` (2 m), read off the live component rather than repeated here, so a retuned serpent
// retunes the approach with it. At `grabRange` vanilla lands the grab and `Serpent_Loop` takes
// over from position 0 - which is where this row sits at its seams, so that handoff is stepless.
//
// **THERE WERE TIERS HERE, AND THERE ARE NOT ANY MORE (§125).** Three rows chosen by distance
// became two in §120, because the serpent crosses six metres too fast for a middle rung to be
// held long enough to feel. The 2026-08-25 runs then showed that two rows is not a fix for the
// same problem: the ladder was never slow - it switched 1.50 s and 1.86 s apart, which is the
// dwell it was given and nothing more - it was *coarse*, one step in six metres with three
// unresponsive metres either side. Adding rungs back was the move already rejected. Scaling one
// row is what replaced them, and with it went the tier table, the boundary fractions, the
// hysteresis and the minimum dwell: there are no boundaries to flap across and no crossing that
// can arrive faster than it can be felt, because there is no crossing.
//
// AND IT IS HELD THROUGH A BLINK. The gaze gate below answers per frame, and the 2026-08-24 run
// showed the answer flickering while the player is plainly still being hypnotised.
// `SerpentHypnosisViewGrace` is how long a lost pull keeps what is playing - the row and the
// intensity both - before the filler gets the device back.
//
// AND ONLY WHILE THE CAMERA IS ACTUALLY BEING PULLED. `InPlayerView` below is the gate that was
// missing: the serpent hypnotising and the serpent *doing something to the player* are not the
// same condition, and a player who turns their back is in the second gap.

	//
	// The ladder was never slow - the 2026-08-25 run switched tiers 1.50 s and 1.86 s apart,
	// which is `SerpentHypnosisMinDwell` and nothing else - it was *coarse*. Two tiers over the
	// 8 m-to-2 m band is one step, at 5 m, so most of the approach produced no change at all,
	// and adding tiers back is the move the 2026-08-23 run already rejected: a step too short to
	// register is not a step.
	//
	// What makes the third option possible is that Edi can change amplitude **without changing
	// what is playing**. `POST /Edi/Intensity/{max}` scales the device's stroke range between the
	// bounds configured for it; DeviceBase debounces the write 100 ms and applies it in place, and
	// nothing re-dispatches the gallery. Measured rather than believed (§106 is the standing
	// warning about this exact shortcut): against a Handy 2 Pro with the patched Edi this project
	// ships, `v2/slide` max followed 100/70/40/20 step for step and the playback phase stayed
	// within 22 ms of prediction across six changes, one of them across a loop seam.
	//
	// So the tiers, the hysteresis and the dwell all go: there are no boundaries to flap across
	// and no crossing that can arrive too fast to feel, because there is no crossing. The view
	// grace stays and means what it always did - a lost pull holds what is playing, which on this
	// path is the last intensity as well as the row.
	//
	// The two rate limits are not tuning knobs so much as the shape of the transport. Distance
	// changes every frame and the device cannot feel a 1% step, so `SerpentHypnosisIntensityStep`
	// is what keeps a walk down the band from becoming sixty requests a second, and
	// `SerpentHypnosisIntensityInterval` sits at Edi's own 100 ms debounce, below which a write
	// is discarded before it reaches the hardware anyway.

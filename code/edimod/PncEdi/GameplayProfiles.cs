/// One switch that says which rules are in force, in place of four booleans that had to agree.
///
/// Before this, "what is this mod doing to the game right now" was the conjunction of
/// `EnableGameplayTweaks`, `GodMode`, `EnableHeatLocks` and a dozen sub-toggles, and several of
/// their 2^n combinations are not a game anyone wants - god mode *and* heat locks, or locks with
/// tweaks off so nothing reads them. A profile is the answer to that: pick one row of the table,
/// and the mod is internally consistent by construction.
///
/// **Custom is the default, and that is deliberate.** It means "read the individual settings, as
/// before", so an existing `com.edi.pnc.cfg` keeps behaving exactly as it did - upgrading must not
/// silently retune someone's game. The other three are opt-in, from the mod manager or the config.
///
/// Every gameplay patch stays installed under every profile and gates on
/// <see cref="TweaksEnabled"/> instead. That is what makes switching safe while a run is going: no
/// patch is ever added or removed at runtime, so there is no half-patched state to land in. What
/// the switch does have to do is undo the *stats* the previous profile wrote onto the player, which
/// is <see cref="OnProfileChanged"/>'s whole job.
///
/// Deliberately **not** ported from the fork this came from, because each would have been a second
/// rule for something this tree already decides once (§124's "one rule where there were two"):
///
/// - a per-class `ClassLockCounts` table. `HeatLockScaleSource` + `HeatLockUnitsPerLock` already
///   derive the lock count from the character's own capacity, which is the same fix for the same
///   problem (classes wanting different lock counts) expressed as a rule rather than a list.
/// - `BaseSpawnMultiplier` / `MaxSpawnBonus`. `SpawnCountMultiplier` and
///   `SpawnCountMultiplierAtFullLock` already state both ends of that ramp directly, which
///   `GameplayHooks.SpawnMultiplier` explains at length is the point.
/// - `HealthRegenAtFullPressure`. `ApplyHeatScaledAutoHeal` already scales regeneration by
///   `(1 - heat)^2`, and locks raise the heat floor, so regeneration already falls away as pressure
///   builds. A second lerp on lock progress would count the same pressure twice.

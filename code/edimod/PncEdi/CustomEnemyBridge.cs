/// <summary>
/// The whole seam between this mod and the custom-enemy plugin, and the reason that plugin can be
/// a separate DLL at all.
///
/// The dependency runs one way: `PncCustomEnemies` references `PncEdi` (it plays rows, registers
/// gallery names, takes heat locks - it is Edi content), and `PncEdi` must not reference it back or
/// neither could be built without the other. But a handful of core decisions genuinely need to know
/// whether a package is involved: the shuffle pool has to draw custom enemies, the escape gate has
/// to honour a package's own scene length, and the filler must not take the channel back while a
/// charm circle is playing.
///
/// So those questions are asked through delegates that the custom-enemy plugin installs in its own
/// Awake, and every one of them has an answer for "nothing installed them" - which is exactly what
/// a player who deleted `PncCustomEnemies.dll` gets. Read every accessor here as "and if that mod
/// is not loaded, the vanilla answer".
///
/// <see cref="NameRemap.CustomEnemyResolver"/> is the same idea and predates this file; it stays
/// where it is because naming is resolved before anything here exists.

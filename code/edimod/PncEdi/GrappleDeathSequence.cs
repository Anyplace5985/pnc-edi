// Death while something is grappling you plays out as that creature's trio scene instead of
// being deferred behind a fake 1 HP. The player's health stays at 0, struggling stops working,
// and more of whatever is clinging is called in until vanilla's trio overflow escalates the
// grapple into the GrabScreen scene - which then counts as the game over via HeatLockSystem's
// pending flag.
//
// Reinforcement spawns are normally optional (GrappleReinforcement), but the sequence needs a
// full pile to reach the overflow, so while it runs the spawner is forced on and runs on its own
// faster interval.
//
// Every stage has a bail-out. This is a death the player cannot escape, so a stall here
// would strand the run exactly like the softlock this replaced.
//
// **It was imp-only until §114, and that was a hole rather than a policy.** The clinging enemies
// are what make the sequence necessary in the first place: a grapple owns the screen, so no grab
// can start while one runs, and the death needs a grab. With goonshrooms attached the sequence
// declined and the old revive-to-1-HP path took over - which is being invulnerable while
// grappled, the exact behaviour this replaced. Vanilla is family-neutral here and always was:
// `TriggerTrioGrabOverflow` reads `trioGrabAnimatorController` and the camera offsets off
// whichever clinger it picks, and the goonshroom prefab carries `GoonShroom_GrabScreen` the same
// way the imp carries `Imp_Grab_Screen`. Read out of the prefabs before this was widened, not
// assumed.
//
// One thing this now leans on: forcing max heat drives the goonshroom's grab screen into its cum
// clip, whose animator parameter is `Max Heat` rather than `MaxHeat` on that one controller.
// §109's `GrabScreenHeatParam` is what makes that fire; without it this death would reach the
// scene and the scene would sit on its loop.

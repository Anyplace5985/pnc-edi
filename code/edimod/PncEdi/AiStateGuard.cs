// Watchdog for "in a coroutine-driven state with no coroutine" - the invariant behind bug #14.
//
// Every one of these AI classes drives itself from UpdateStateMachine, which switches on
// currentState. Auditing all six against the assembly, two of them have non-Dead states with
// **no case in that switch**, so the state machine cannot act while in them and the only way
// out is the driving coroutine finishing:
//
//   | class                  | states                                        | unhandled          |
//   | EnemyAI                | Idle Chasing Attacking Grabbing Dead          | Dead only          |
//   | ChargingEnemyAI        | Idle Chasing PreparingCharge Charging Dead    | PreparingCharge,   |
//   |                        | Stunned                                       | Charging           |
//   | ProjectileEnemyAI      | Idle Chasing Retreating Shooting Dead         | Dead only          |
//   | SpinningEnemyAI        | Idle Spinning Grabbing Shooting Dead          | Grabbing, Shooting |
//   | DragonEnemyAI          | Idle Chasing Attacking Grabbing Dead          | Dead only          |
//   | ProximityDragonEnemyAI | Idle Chasing Attacking Grabbing Dead          | Dead only          |
//
// Dead being unhandled is intended. The other four handle every state they can enter and
// recover on their own, so they are deliberately NOT patched here.

// Game 0.3.2 added ChargingEnemyAI.Stunned, and it is deliberately NOT in StuckStates below.
// Vanilla enters it when the player shakes a grappler off and leaves it from UpdateStateMachine
// on a plain `Time.time >= stunEndTime` test, so it is a state the switch *does* handle - the
// opposite of the invariant this guard watches. Guarding it would cut short three seconds of
// helplessness the game now grants on purpose. `patchaudit.py --ai` reports it as unhandled
// because that check only counts a branch that calls `Handle*`, and Stunned's branch calls
// TransitionToChasing/TransitionToIdle directly; the same heuristic has always reported
// PreparingCharge for the same reason.
//
// StuckStates is keyed by the *numeric* enum value, and 0.3.2 appended Stunned after Dead, so
// PreparingCharge and Charging are still 2 and 3. A build that inserted a state rather than
// appending one would silently re-point both entries at the wrong states, which is what
// EnemyAiAudit.AuditStateValues exists to catch - it asserts the names still sit at those
// numbers at startup, and it passed on 0.3.2.
//
// Both vulnerable classes commit the state before the coroutine is known to be running:
//
//   TransitionToGrabbing()  { currentState = Grabbing; StopSpin(); StopShooting(); StartGrab(); }
//   StartGrab()             { if (grabCoroutine != null) return;  if (!canGrab) return;
//                             if (grabScreen == null) return;  grabCoroutine = StartCoroutine(...); }
//
//   TransitionToCharging()  { currentState = Charging; StopPathfinding(); StartCharge(); }
//   StartCharge()           { if (chargeCoroutine != null) return;  if (player == null) return;
//                             chargeCoroutine = StartCoroutine(ChargeSequence()); }
//
// Any of those early-outs leaves the enemy in a state nothing can leave. Observed on Plantasha
// as state=Grabbing with every gate open and every coroutine null (§46).
//
// Watching the invariant rather than fixing TransitionToGrabbing is deliberate: there are four
// routes into that state per class, the sibling TransitionToShooting/TransitionToPreparingCharge
// have the same shape, and even a perfect transition still leaves a state the switch cannot
// handle. The condition is one line; the ways of reaching it are not.
//
// PreparingCharge and Charging are both driven by chargeCoroutine - PreparingCharge is assigned
// from inside ChargeSequence itself, so the same handle covers both.

// The comment on AiStateGuard says watching the invariant beats fixing TransitionToGrabbing, and
// that still holds for the general case - four routes in, and even a perfect transition leaves a
// state the switch cannot handle. This is the one case where the answer is decidable *before* the
// commit: SpinningEnemyAI.StartGrab early-outs on `!canGrab` and on `grabScreen == null`, and both
// are plain state readable from the prefix. Nothing about the transition can make either true.
//
// §130 is what this was written for. A movement-only custom enemy - CharmWitchController sets
// `canGrab = false` to hold the vanilla grab shut while keeping the borrowed chase movement - sat
// in grab range and lunged twice a second for as long as the player stood there. The cycle is
// TransitionToGrabbing committing Grabbing, StartGrab declining on !canGrab, AiStateGuard
// unsticking to Idle 0.5 s later, and grab range immediately transitioning again: 20 unsticks in
// one run, every one of them that enemy, in unbroken 0.5 s trains. The watchdog was doing its job;
// what it recovered from was being re-created as fast as it cleared it.
//
// A vanilla spinner reaches this the moment anything clears canGrab, so the gate is on the class
// rather than on the witch.
//
// Declining the transition leaves currentState where it was - Idle or Spinning, both handled by
// UpdateStateMachine - so the enemy goes on being driven instead of parked. The skipped
// StopSpin/StopShooting go with it, which is correct: those exist to make room for a grab that is
// not going to happen.

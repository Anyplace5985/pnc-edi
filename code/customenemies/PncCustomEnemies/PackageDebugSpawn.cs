/// package was spawned by the framework's `Tools / SpawnCustomEnemyKey` while the Joker Wall Trap
/// bound its own `Wall Picture Traps / PlaceTrapKey` — so a second trap package would have brought a
/// third key in a fourth config section, while ten enemy packages went on sharing one. The
/// framework has the key and the id selector; what it lacked was a way to say "place *your* thing"
/// to a kind it does not implement. <see cref="IPackageDebugSpawn"/> is that, and this is the
/// dispatcher over both halves.
///
/// The id resolution lives here rather than in either half, because "which package did you mean"
/// is one question across the whole install and answering it twice is how the two answers drift.

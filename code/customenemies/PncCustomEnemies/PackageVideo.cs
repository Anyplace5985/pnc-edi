/// Turning a manifest's video filename into a URL Unity can actually play, on this platform.
///
/// **Unity's VideoPlayer does not decode H.264 on Linux.** It has no decoder of its own for it:
/// on Windows it hands the file to Media Foundation and on macOS to AVFoundation, and the Linux
/// standalone player has no equivalent to hand it to. What it *does* carry on every platform is
/// libvpx, so VP8 (and VP9) in a WebM container plays everywhere. The custom-enemy packages ship
/// H.264 MP4, which is why the witch's dream-cloud overlays are a black rectangle on Linux while
/// being fine on Windows - and why the failure is so quiet: `Prepare()` simply never completes,
/// there is no exception, and a transparent overlay with nothing in it looks like a design choice.
///
/// So: prefer a `.webm` sibling of whatever the manifest names, on every platform. WebM plays
/// everywhere, which makes one package work on both without the manifest having to say so and
/// without a package author having to think about it. Where no sibling exists the declared file is
/// used unchanged - correct on Windows, and on Linux it logs what is wrong and how to fix it
/// rather than leaving a black rectangle to be diagnosed from scratch.
///
/// `code/webmify.py` does the conversion.

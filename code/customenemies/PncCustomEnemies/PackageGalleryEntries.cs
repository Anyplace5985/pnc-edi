/// Before §165 this was `WallPictureTrapRegistry` called by name from six places in

/// manifest and its own display - impossible to move out of the framework. Now a module says what
/// it owns and how it should look, and the framework keeps the viewer.
///
/// **A provider disappears when its package's code is switched off, and that is the intended
/// behaviour for the entries but not for the media**: an entry contributed by a module is gone from
/// the gallery until the code is allowed to run, because nothing else knows the entry exists. A
/// package that wants its gallery to work without its code should declare it in `enemy.json`
/// (`scenes`, `galleryVideos`), which the framework reads on its own.

///
/// **This registry is what keeps the framework empty of enemy-specific code without taking the
/// no-code path away with it.** A behaviour lives in the package that ships it; a name makes it
/// reachable by any other package, none of which needs a compiler. The framework knows only that
/// some string maps to something implementing <see cref="IPackageBehaviourFactory"/>, and never
/// what a charm circle or a wall trap is.
///
/// A name that nothing provides is an ordinary, visible failure: the enemy still loads as its
/// reskin and the log says which package would have to be installed. That is the "inert and
/// visible, never silently plausible" rule the alias gap taught (§133) applied to behaviours.

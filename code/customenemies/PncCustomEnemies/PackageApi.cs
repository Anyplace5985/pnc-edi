/// letting a renamed member surface as a MissingMethodException in the middle of a run.

/// The framework asks its questions through the interfaces below rather than naming a behaviour's
/// type, so a package's code is reachable without the loader knowing anything about it. That is the
/// whole point of the seam (§165): before it, "a charm-circle boss" and "a wall-picture trap" were
